# TiltToSurvive
<br> Do you remmber the golden age of mobile games? The age in which a game could be developed and distributed without the aim to put an advertisement after each pushed button?
<br> Well let's go back to that period and unbury one of my favorite games of all times: "Tilt to Live!".
<br> This fairly simple game is about moving an arrow across the screen and dodging red dots that spawn and chase the player.
<br> To move the player the gyroscope is used and thus the "Tilt" in the title. 

This repository aims at reproducing this cool mobile game, which has been lost throughout software and hardware updates, in a webapp game format. The final goal is to be able to play this game for free from everywhere also thanks to a kubernetes cluster implementation.

#### Ispiration:
This video is an example of a small match:<br>


## The Game Engine
As a game engine I'm ussing Godot as it's open source and fairly simple to get started with

## The Game System
The chosen system is mobile web browser. This is a strange choice but I think it's the best to keep the low maintenance and broad device support that I'm looking forward. Also this will help me figure out how to put the game online and to work with containers

## To play the game 
There will be a link from which you can access the game but of course you can also download and build it from goddot and run it on your own
